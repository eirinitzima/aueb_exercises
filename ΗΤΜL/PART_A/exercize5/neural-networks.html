                We are on the brink of a renaissance in neural network research. A new chapter in geometric deep learning is emerging. It represents innovation and suggests untapped potential. The foundation is shifting toward vectors. This change is not a mere evolution; it is a bold step into a new era. In this era, neural networks gain an intuition of the geometry of our world. This work focuses on Vector Neural Networks (VNNs). VNNs serve as a foundation that pushes us toward intelligent and interconnected systems, reflecting the complex dynamics of the real world, leading us toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

                There are two great things about this book. First, it is available for free, so consider donating to Nielsen with me if you get something out of it. And second, it focuses on walking you through some code and data you can download yourself, covering the same example I present in this video. Long live active learning!

                Neural networks mimic the behavior of the human brain, enabling computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Chief Inventor Martin Keen makes some key points about neural networks in just 5 minutes.

                <h3>The Essential Main Ideas of Neural Networks</h3>

                Neural Networks are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, yet also one of the most misunderstood. People often call them "black boxes," but this is far from true. In this video, I break down each component and show how it works, step-by-step, using simple math that stays true to the algorithm. By the end of the video, you will have a deep understanding of what Neural Networks actually do.
